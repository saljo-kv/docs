Run the following command to install Netra in your environment

<CodeGroup>

```shellscript pip
pip install netra-sdk
```


```shellscript poetry
poetry add netra-sdk
```

</CodeGroup>

## Optional Dependencies

Netra SDK supports optional dependencies for enhanced functionality:

### LLM-Guard for Prompt Injection Protection

To use the full functionality of prompt injection scanning provided by llm-guard:

<CodeGroup>

```shellscript pip
pip install 'netra-sdk[llm_guard]'
```


```shellscript poetry
poetry add netra-sdk --extras "llm_guard"
```

</CodeGroup>

**Note for Intel Mac users**: The `llm-guard` package has a dependency on PyTorch, which may cause installation issues on Intel Mac machines. The base SDK will install and function correctly without llm-guard, with limited prompt injection scanning capabilities. When `llm-guard` is not available, Netra will log appropriate warnings and continue to operate with fallback behavior.
