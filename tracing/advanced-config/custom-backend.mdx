---

Since Netra SDK follows the OpenTelemetry standard, you can integrate it with any OpenTelemetry-compatible observability backend. This section explains how to configure custom endpoints and leverage the benefits of OpenTelemetry compatibility.

## Popular OpenTelemetry Backends

Netra SDK is compatible with a wide range of observability platforms:

- **Jaeger** - Distributed tracing platform
- **Zipkin** - Distributed tracing system
- **Prometheus** - Monitoring and alerting toolkit
- **Grafana** - Observability and data visualization
- **New Relic** - Full-stack observability platform
- **Datadog** - Monitoring and analytics platform
- **Honeycomb** - Observability for complex systems
- **Lightstep** - Distributed tracing and observability
- **AWS X-Ray** - Distributed tracing service
- **Google Cloud Trace** - Distributed tracing system

## Custom Endpoint Configuration

### Recommended: Environment Variable Configuration

The simplest way to configure a custom backend is through environment variables:

<CodeGroup>

```bash bash
# Set custom OTLP endpoint via environment variables
export NETRA_OTLP_ENDPOINT="https://your-custom-backend.com/v1/traces"
export NETRA_HEADERS="authorization=Bearer your-token"
```

</CodeGroup>

The SDK will automatically pick up these environment variables during initialization:

<CodeGroup>

```python python
from netra import Netra
from netra.instrumentation.instruments import InstrumentSet

# Simple initialization - SDK automatically picks up environment variables
Netra.init(app_name="Your App", instruments={InstrumentSet.OPENAI})
# No endpoint configuration needed in code!
```

</CodeGroup>

## Benefits of OpenTelemetry Compatibility

1. **Vendor Agnostic**
   - Switch between observability platforms without code changes
   - No vendor lock-in
   - Easy migration between different monitoring systems
2. **Standard Format**
   - Consistent telemetry data across all tools
   - Standardized data model and protocols
   - Interoperable with any OpenTelemetry-compatible system
3. **Flexible Integration**
   - Works with existing observability infrastructure
   - Easy to integrate with current monitoring solutions
   - No major architectural changes required
4. **Future Proof**
   - Built on industry-standard protocols
   - Adapts to new observability tools and platforms
   - Long-term maintainability
5. **Rich Ecosystem**
   - Leverage the entire OpenTelemetry ecosystem
   - Access to a wide range of tools and integrations
   - Active community support
