description: "Easily instrument your code with our custom decorators `@workflow`, `@agent`, and `@task`"

Netra SDK offers a set of powerful decorators to simplify the process of instrumenting your AI applications. By adding a simple decorator to your functions or classes, you can automatically create spans, track execution, and capture valuable telemetry data without cluttering your code with manual tracing calls.

Our three main decorators are:
- `@workflow`: For high-level business transactions or main entry points.
- `@agent`: For AI agents or complex components that orchestrate multiple tasks.
- `@task`: For individual units of work or sub-processes within a workflow or agent.

## `@workflow`

The `@workflow` decorator is designed to trace the entire lifecycle of a high-level operation or business workflow. It's ideal for wrapping main functions that orchestrate multiple steps.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from netra.decorators import workflow

@workflow
def data_processing_workflow(data):
    """Main workflow for processing data"""
    cleaned_data = clean_data(data)
    return analyze_data(cleaned_data)
```

</CodeGroup>

You can also provide a custom name for the workflow span:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
@workflow(name="Custom Workflow Name")
def my_workflow():
    # ...
```

</CodeGroup>

## `@agent`

The `@agent` decorator is suited for instrumenting AI agents or classes that encapsulate a specific set of responsibilities. When applied to a class, it will automatically instrument all of its public methods.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from netra.decorators import agent

@agent
class CustomerSupportAgent:
    def handle_query(self, query):
        # This method is automatically traced
        return self.process_query(query)

    def escalate_issue(self, issue):
        # This method is also traced
        return self.forward_to_human(issue)
```

</CodeGroup>

## `@task`

Use the `@task` decorator for more granular tracing of individual functions or methods that represent a single step or task within a larger workflow.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from netra.decorators import task

@task
def data_validation_task(data):
    """Task for validating input data"""
    # This function's execution is traced as a separate span
    return validate_schema(data)
```

</CodeGroup>

## Async Support

All decorators fully support `async` functions out of the box.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from netra.decorators import workflow

@workflow(name="Async Data Pipeline")
async def async_workflow(data):
    result = await process_data_async(data)
    return result
```
