Auto instrumentation is a feature that automatically adds observability capabilities (tracing, metrics, and logging) to applications without requiring manual code modifications. It works by dynamically injecting monitoring code into your application at runtime or during the build process.

Auto instrumentation significantly reduces the implementation overhead for observability. Instead of manually adding tracing calls throughout your codebase, it automatically captures relevant data from popular frameworks, databases, HTTP clients, and other common libraries. This approach ensures consistent instrumentation across your application while minimizing the risk of missing critical telemetry data.

Netra provided auto instrumentation of all major LLMs, Vector Databases, Web Framworks and AI Frameworks.
